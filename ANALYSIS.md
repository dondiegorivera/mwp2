Excellent work on this project. You've built a robust, well-structured, and modern machine learning workbench that goes far beyond a simple script. The use of Polars, Hydra, PyTorch Lightning, and a clear project structure with documentation (`PROJECT.md`, `basics.md`) and tests is professional-grade.

Let's dive deep into your request. I will compare your implementation against the provided research, highlighting strengths, identifying fundamental gaps, and proposing a clear path forward.

### Overall Assessment

Your repository is a fantastic starting point. It correctly implements a standard, yet powerful, workflow for applying a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) to financial data. The architecture is sound, the data pipeline is logical, and the training process incorporates best practices like weighted sampling and comprehensive callbacks.

You have successfully built the "vanilla" but state-of-the-art TFT pipeline that the research papers describe as the baseline. Now, the interesting part is layering on the more advanced, finance-specific concepts from the research to elevate it.

### Comparison with Research Findings

Here is a breakdown of how your project aligns with and differs from the key themes in the provided research.

#### 1. Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

| Feature Category | Research Findings | Your Project's Status | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Price/Volume** | Essential. OHLC, volume, derived returns, and price ranges are common. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | Your `data.py` does this very well. You compute log-returns, which is standard practice. |
| **Technical Indicators** | Crucial. RSI, MACD, Moving Averages, Volatility, Skew, Kurtosis are frequently used to capture momentum and regimes. | ‚úÖ **Good** | You've included a solid set: `volatility_20d`, `skew_20d`, `kurtosis_20d`, `rsi_14d`, and `macd`. This is a great start. |
| **Calendar Features** | Critical "known future" inputs. Day-of-week, month, holidays, quarter-ends. | ‚úÖ **Good** | You correctly implement `day_of_week`, `month`, and `is_quarter_end` as known future inputs. This properly utilizes one of TFT's core strengths. |
| **Static Features** | Important for context. Sector, market cap. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | You correctly create and use `ticker_id` and `sector_id` as static categorical features, which allows the model to learn per-stock and per-sector embeddings. |
| **Macroeconomic Data** | A common way to boost performance. VIX, interest rates (FEDFUNDS), GDP, market indices (S&P 500). | ‚ùå **Missing** | Your pipeline is currently "siloed" ‚Äî it only knows about the history of the individual stock. It has no context of the broader market environment. |
| **Alternative Data** | A frontier for SOTA performance. News sentiment (FinBERT), social media, investor attention (Google Trends). | ‚ùå **Missing** | This is another significant opportunity. The research highlights that sentiment is a powerful, often orthogonal, signal to price action. |
| **Fundamental Data** | Used in more advanced models. Quarterly earnings, P/E ratios. | ‚ùå **Missing** | Your model doesn't incorporate any company-specific fundamental data, which can be a strong driver of long-term price movements. |
| **Cross-Asset Features** | Captures relative performance and contagion. Stock return vs. sector return, correlation with market index. | ‚ùå **Missing** | The model doesn't know if a stock is moving up because the whole market is, or if it's outperforming its peers. |

#### 2. Model Architecture & Configuration

| Aspect | Research Findings | Your Project's Status | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Architecture** | Hybrid LSTM/Attention model. Uses `pytorch-forecasting` or similar libraries. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | You use the standard `pytorch-forecasting` TFT implementation, wrapped in a clean `GlobalTFT` Lightning module. This is the correct approach. |
| **Input Handling** | Natively handles static, known-future, and observed-past variables. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | Your `train.py` script and data configuration correctly map your engineered features to these three distinct input types, fully leveraging the TFT architecture. |
| **Probabilistic Forecasts** | A key benefit. Uses **Quantile Loss** to predict intervals (e.g., p05, p50, p95), quantifying uncertainty. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | Your default configuration (`conf/model/tft_default.yaml`) correctly uses `QuantileLoss`. This is a huge advantage over models that only predict a single point and is a major theme in the research. |
| **Interpretability** | A major selling point of TFT. Variable selection networks and attention weights can be analyzed. | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Partially Implemented** | You are not yet leveraging this. Your `evaluate.py` script focuses on predictive metrics. The research emphasizes that a key benefit is analyzing *why* the model made a prediction. |

#### 3. Training & Evaluation

| Aspect | Research Findings | Your Project's Status | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Training Framework** | PyTorch Lightning is a common choice for its robustness and callbacks. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | Your project is built entirely on this principle. |
| **Overfitting Control** | Early stopping, learning rate schedulers, dropout, and sometimes regularization are essential. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | You've correctly implemented `EarlyStopping`, `LearningRateMonitor`, `ModelCheckpoint`, and gradient clipping. |
| **Data Sampling** | For panel data, it's important to avoid having large entities (like AAPL) dominate training. | ‚úÖ **Excellent** | Your use of `WeightedRandomSampler` is a sophisticated and correct solution to this exact problem. This is a sign of a very well-thought-out training pipeline. |
| **Training Objective** | Standard is Quantile Loss. Advanced models optimize for financial metrics like Sharpe Ratio (`TFT-ASRO`). | ‚ùå **Standard Only** | You use Quantile Loss, which is great. However, the research points to a major evolution: optimizing for a financial goal directly, not just statistical accuracy. |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Go beyond MAE/RMSE. Directional accuracy, PI coverage. For finance: Sharpe, Max Drawdown, Turnover. | ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Good, but Incomplete** | Your `evaluate.py` computes MAE, coverage, and directional accuracy, which is a strong start. However, it lacks the financial backtesting metrics that determine if the model is actually profitable. Your own `PROJECT.md` correctly identifies this as a necessary step (Step 6). |

### Fundamental Problems & Missed Opportunities

Based on the comparison, here are the key high-level issues and opportunities for your project.

1.  **The Data Silo: The Model is Blind to Market Context.**
    This is the most significant and fundamental gap. Your model currently operates in a vacuum, using only a stock's own past data. The research overwhelmingly shows that superior performance comes from integrating external context. A stock's price is driven by company-specific news, sector trends, and broad market sentiment. Without these, your model can only extrapolate historical patterns and will be completely blindsided by market-wide shocks or regime changes.

2.  **The Goal Mismatch: Optimizing for Statistics, Not Profit.**
    Your model is trained to minimize quantile loss. This produces statistically accurate predictions and uncertainty bounds, which is a great first step. However, a model with a slightly higher MAE might be vastly more profitable if it correctly predicts the direction of large moves. The research on `TFT-ASRO` (optimizing for Sharpe Ratio) points directly at this: the ultimate goal is better risk-adjusted returns, not lower statistical error.

3.  **The "So What?" Problem: Lack of Financial Backtesting.**
    Your evaluation shows that the model has a certain MAE and directional accuracy. An investor's first question would be: "So what? Can I make money with this?" Without a proper backtest that simulates a trading strategy (including transaction costs, position sizing, etc.) and reports financial metrics (Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown), the model's practical utility is unknown. Your `PROJECT.md` correctly plans for this, but it's a crucial missing piece of the puzzle.

### Actionable Recommendations: Your Battle Plan 2.0

Here is a prioritized set of recommendations to evolve your project from a strong academic baseline into a SOTA financial forecasting system, directly inspired by the research.

#### Phase 1: Break the Data Silo (Highest Priority)

The goal is to give your model market awareness.

1.  **Add Market-Wide Features:** This is the easiest and likely most impactful first step.
    *   **Action:** Modify `create_features_and_targets` in `data.py`.
    *   **Features:**
        *   Load S&P 500 (SPY) or Nasdaq (QQQ) daily data.
        *   Calculate the market's daily log-return.
        *   Add `market_return_1d` as a `time_varying_unknown_real`.
        *   Calculate the VIX index (a measure of market volatility) and add it as another feature.
    *   **Hypothesis:** The model will learn to distinguish between a stock dropping on its own vs. dropping because the entire market is crashing.

2.  **Incorporate Macroeconomic Data:**
    *   **Action:** Find a source for key macro data (e.g., FRED for Federal Funds Rate).
    *   **Features:** Add the 10-Year Treasury Yield and the effective Federal Funds Rate as `time_varying_known_reals` (as their future values are often scheduled or slow-moving).
    *   **Hypothesis:** The model can learn how changes in interest rate environments affect stock valuations.

3.  **Integrate News Sentiment (Advanced):**
    *   **Action:** This is a larger step. You could use a pre-trained FinBERT model to score headlines for your specific stocks from a news API.
    *   **Features:** Add `news_sentiment_score` and `news_volume` as `time_varying_unknown_reals`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** As shown by Hajek & Novotny (2024), this can significantly boost accuracy by capturing market psychology.

#### Phase 2: Align with Financial Reality

The goal is to train and evaluate the model on what matters: risk-adjusted returns.

1.  **Implement the Full Backtesting Framework:**
    *   **Action:** Build out Step 6 from your `PROJECT.md`. Create a new script, e.g., `src/market_prediction_workbench/backtest.py`.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Take the predictions from `evaluate.py`.
        *   Define a simple trading strategy (e.g., "go long if predicted 1d return > 0.05%, go short if < -0.05%").
        *   Simulate this over your test set, including a realistic transaction cost (e.g., 5 bps).
        *   Calculate and report: **Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, and Annualized Return.**
    *   **Result:** You can now compare models based on their simulated profitability, not just their MAE.

2.  **Experiment with a Custom, Financially-Aware Loss Function:**
    *   **Action:** In `model.py`, create a custom loss function that can be used instead of `QuantileLoss`.
    *   **Idea:** A simple start would be a weighted MSE loss, where you apply a much higher penalty if the sign of your prediction is wrong (`sign(pred) != sign(true)`). A more advanced version could try to approximate the Sharpe ratio over a mini-batch.
    *   **Hypothesis:** This will train the model to care more about getting the *direction* right, which is paramount for trading, potentially at the expense of a slightly higher overall error.

#### Phase 3: Leverage Full Interpretability

The goal is to understand *why* the model is making its predictions.

1.  **Analyze Feature Importance:**
    *   **Action:** After training, use `pytorch-forecasting`'s built-in interpretation tools. The TFT model object has methods like `model.interpret_output()`.
    *   **Visualize:**
        *   Plot the overall feature importance scores (from the Variable Selection Networks). This will tell you if `rsi_14d` is more important than `month`.
        *   Plot the attention weights over time for a few specific predictions. This will show you which past days the model focused on to make its forecast.
    *   **Result:** You can validate if the model is learning sensible patterns (e.g., paying attention to high volume days) and gain trust in its outputs.

By following this plan, you will systematically address the fundamental gaps identified and directly incorporate the most potent ideas from the research literature. Your project has an outstanding foundation; these steps will build upon it to create a truly cutting-edge market prediction workbench.
